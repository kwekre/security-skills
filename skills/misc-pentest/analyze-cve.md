# CVE Vulnerability Analysis Workflow

## Purpose

This workflow provides a structured methodology for analyzing whether a CVE affecting a project dependency poses a real security risk. It:
- Traces vulnerable code paths in your application
- Analyzes dataflow from user input to vulnerable functions
- Creates proof-of-concept HTTP requests for Burp Suite validation

**Language/Framework Agnostic**: Works with Python, Node.js, Java, Go, Ruby, PHP, and more.

## Important Assumptions

### Trust User-Provided Information
- **The user has already verified the CVE and version through SCA tools** (Snyk, Dependabot, GitHub Security, etc.)
- **Trust the dependency name, version, and CVE information provided** - do not require verification
- **Do not fail if dependency files are missing or incomplete** - focus on code analysis
- **Do not stop if packages aren't installed locally** - many projects use private artifactories or complex build processes
- **Your job is to analyze CODE USAGE**, not verify dependency versions

### What This Means
- If the user says "analyze CVE-X in package Y version Z", proceed with the analysis
- Look for usage of the vulnerable code in the application
- If you can't find dependency files, document this but continue the analysis
- If the package isn't locally installed, work with the CVE description to understand what to look for

## CHAIN COMMITMENTS — DECLARE BEFORE STARTING

Read this before executing any workflow phase. Commit to MANDATORY chains before your first tool call.

| Trigger | Chain | Mandatory? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| After `session(action="complete")` (confirmed exploitable finding) | `/gh-export` | OPTIONAL — user request only |
| Exploitable CVE confirmed + live target available | `/web-exploit` | OPTIONAL |
| Exploitable CVE confirmed + Metasploit module available | `/metasploit` | OPTIONAL |

> **Invoking a chained skill:** follow the per-client invocation table in the project's CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md — do not hard-code client-specific syntax here.



**Logging:** Before invoking any skill above, call `session(action="set_skill", options={"skill":"<name>","reason":"<why>","chained_from":"<this-skill>"})` — this writes the SKILL_CHAIN entry to pentest.log.

## Analysis Workflow

### Phase 1: Vulnerability Context Gathering

1. **Read CVE Details**
   - Fetch and analyze CVE from provided link
   - Identify vulnerable function/method/class
   - Understand attack vector and vulnerability type
   - Note affected version range
   - Document any PoC or exploit details
   - Search Exploit-DB for existing exploits: `kali(command="searchsploit <product> <version>")`

2. **Trust User-Provided Version Information**
   - **IMPORTANT**: Trust the user's input about dependency version and CVE applicability
   - User has already verified this information through SCA tools (Snyk, Dependabot, etc.)
   - **Optional**: If dependency files are available, you MAY verify the version:
     - Python: `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `Pipfile`
     - Node.js: `package.json`, `package-lock.json`
     - Java: `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `build.gradle.kts`
     - Go: `go.mod`
     - Ruby: `Gemfile`, `Gemfile.lock`
     - PHP: `composer.json`
   - **DO NOT stop analysis** if:
     - Dependency files are missing or inaccessible
     - The package is not found in lock files
     - Private artifactories require authentication
     - Dependencies are not locally installed
   - **Always proceed to Phase 2** - focus on analyzing whether the vulnerable code is actually used

### Phase 2: Code Path Analysis

3. **Understand Vulnerable Function from CVE**
   - **Primary source**: Use the CVE description to identify the vulnerable function/method/class
   - Document the vulnerable component (e.g., `jackson-databind.readValue()`, `pymupdf.Document.open()`)
   - Note: You typically **won't have access** to the dependency source code
   - **Optional**: If dependency is installed locally, you may inspect it for additional context
   - Key information needed:
     - Vulnerable module/package name
     - Vulnerable function/method/class name
     - Basic understanding of what triggers the vulnerability

4. **Trace Usage in Application**
   - Search codebase for:
     - **Imports of vulnerable module** (document these as evidence)
     - Instantiation of vulnerable classes
     - Calls to vulnerable functions
   - Document all usage locations with file:line references
   - **IMPORTANT**: For each file using the vulnerable code, capture:
     - The exact import statement(s) showing how the package is imported
     - The import location (file:line)
     - Import type (direct import, aliased, selective import, etc.)
   - This import evidence proves the vulnerable package is actually loaded in the application
   - If NOT used → stop analysis (not exploitable)
   - If used → proceed to Phase 3

### Phase 3: User Input Trace

5. **Identify Entry Points**
   - Map HTTP endpoints that interact with vulnerable code paths
   - Document each endpoint:
     - Route path
     - HTTP method
     - Request parameters (query, body, headers, files)
     - File location

6. **Trace User Input Flow**
   - For each endpoint, trace how user data flows:
     - Request parameter extraction
     - Validation/sanitization steps
     - Data transformations
     - Function calls toward vulnerable code
   - Document complete call chain

### Phase 4: Dataflow Analysis

7. **Construct Dataflow Graph**
   - Show path from SOURCE to SINK:
     - **SOURCE**: User input entry point
     - **INTERMEDIATE**: Each function in the chain
     - **SINK**: Vulnerable function call
   - For each node document:
     - Function name and file location
     - Input parameters
     - Validation/sanitization applied
     - Data transformations
     - Output to next function

8. **Exploitability Assessment**
   - Determine if user input reaches sink without proper sanitization
   - Identify security controls:
     - Input validation
     - Encoding/escaping
     - Authentication/authorization
     - Rate limiting
     - Content-type restrictions
   - Rate exploitability: **HIGH** / **MEDIUM** / **LOW** / **NOT EXPLOITABLE**

### Phase 4b: Execution Confirmation (optional, white-box — when MCP tools are available)

A CVE analysis usually has **no live endpoint** to attack, so the strongest evidence is to actually trigger the vulnerable code path. When the codebase is local and the build is tractable, confirm in the **hardened sandbox** (capabilities dropped, pid/mem/cpu-capped, staged copy — original source untouched; network ON by default so `pip install`/`npm ci` work — pass `allow_network: false` to isolate untrusted code):

```
scan(tool="exec_sandbox", target="<codebase path>", options={
  "subdir": "<smallest dir that builds>",
  "setup":  "pip install -e .",            # or: npm ci / go build ./... / mvn -q compile
  "cmd":    "python repro.py",             # a minimal script that drives user input into the vulnerable sink
  "image":  "python:3.11-slim",            # match the dependency's runtime
  "timeout": 180
})
```
It returns an `artifact_id` with the captured stdout/stderr + exit code. A crash/traceback/exec from the vulnerable function **proves** exploitability — pass the `artifact_id` to `report(action="finding", ...)` as the reproduction artifact and rate it accordingly. If it cannot be built (private artifactories, complex multi-service setup) the tool returns a diagnostic and you simply fall back to the static dataflow trace — **execution confirmation is opt-in and never required**.

### Phase 5: Proof of Concept Development

9. **Craft HTTP Request**
   - Create complete HTTP request for Burp Suite:
     - Target vulnerable endpoint
     - Malicious payload to trigger vulnerability
     - Bypass security controls if possible
   - Format as raw HTTP request

10. **Document Expected Behavior**
    - Describe expected results when request is sent
    - Explain verification steps
    - Provide exploitation indicators

### Phase 5b: Report to Dashboard (when MCP tools are available)

If pentest-agent MCP tools are available (e.g. when chained from `/pentester`), report findings to the live dashboard:

11. **Log confirmed vulnerabilities**
    - Call `report(action="finding", data={...})` with the CVE ID, affected component, exploitability rating, and raw evidence (dataflow trace, code snippets)
    - This makes the finding visible in the live dashboard at localhost:7777

12. **Route PoC through Burp Suite**
    - Call `http(action="request", options={"poc": true})` with the crafted exploit request — this lands it in Burp HTTP History
    - Call `http(action="save_poc", ...)` with a descriptive title (e.g. `cve-2024-xxxxx-rce-upload`) and include the vulnerability description in `notes`
    - This produces a `.http` file in `pocs/` that can be pasted directly into Burp Repeater

> **Skip this phase** if MCP tools are not available (standalone analysis). The markdown report is always produced regardless.

### Phase 6: Report Generation

11. **Compile Findings**
    - Generate comprehensive markdown report
    - Save as: `CVE-YYYY-XXXXX-analysis.md`
    - Include all sections (see template below)
    - **IMPORTANT**: All code snippets must preserve original line numbers from source files
    - **MANDATORY - NEVER SKIP**: The report MUST end with "## Tracking Tool Summary" containing:
      - Concise 1-2 sentence explanation of exploitability or false positive
      - **ALL relevant file paths and line numbers** (imports, usage, entry points, sinks)
      - Format: `[Explanation]. Found in: file.ext:line, file.ext:line`
      - This summary should be copy-paste ready for issue tracking tools
      - **THE REPORT IS INCOMPLETE WITHOUT THIS SECTION**

[Concise explanation of exploitability or why it's a false positive, followed by all relevant file:line references]

**Required Format**: [Explanation]. Found in: `file.ext:line`, `file.ext:line`, `file.ext:line`

**This section MUST always be included at the end of every report**

**Examples**:
- *False Positive*: "The vulnerable function is never called with user-controlled input; all usage is with hardcoded internal configuration values only. Found in: `config/settings.py:45`, `utils/loader.py:123`"
- *False Positive*: "Package is imported but the vulnerable code path is unreachable due to authentication requirements and input validation that prevents exploitation. Import at `api/routes.py:12`, usage at `api/handlers.py:89`"
- *Exploitable*: "User-controlled file uploads directly reach the vulnerable parser without sanitization, enabling remote code execution. Entry point: `api/upload.py:34`, sink: `parsers/document.py:156`"

## Project Auto-Detection

When you run the workflow, the following will be automatically detected:

### Framework Detection
- **Python**: FastAPI, Django, Flask (checks for imports, config files)
- **Node.js**: Express, NestJS, Koa (checks package.json dependencies)
- **Java**: Spring Boot, Jakarta EE (checks pom.xml/build.gradle)
- **Go**: Gin, Echo, Chi (checks import statements in main.go)
- **Ruby**: Rails, Sinatra (checks Gemfile)
- **PHP**: Laravel, Symfony (checks composer.json)

### Entry Point Detection
- API route definitions
- Controller files
- Request handlers
- Middleware configuration

### Dependency File Location
- Automatically searches for dependency manifests
- Reads installed versions
- Checks for lock files for exact versions

### Import Statement Examples (By Language)
When documenting import evidence, look for patterns like:
- **Python**: `import package`, `from package import module`, `from package.submodule import function`
- **Node.js**: `const pkg = require('package')`, `import { function } from 'package'`
- **Java**: `import com.example.package.Class;`, `import com.example.package.*;`
- **Go**: `import "github.com/user/package"`, `import ( ... )`
- **Ruby**: `require 'package'`, `require_relative 'package'`
- **PHP**: `use Vendor\Package\Class;`, `require 'vendor/autoload.php'`

## Best Practices

1. **Be Thorough**: Check all code paths, even indirect ones
2. **Document Everything**: Include file:line references for traceability
3. **Show Import Evidence**: Always capture and display how vulnerable packages are imported as proof they're loaded
4. **Preserve Line Numbers**: All code snippets must include original line numbers from source files for precise traceability
5. **Test Assumptions**: Verify dataflow actually reaches the sink
6. **Consider Context**: Security controls might mitigate vulnerability
7. **Realistic PoC**: Create exploits that work in real application context
8. **Actionable Output**: Provide clear, specific recommendations
9. **Tracking Summary**: Always include a concise 1-2 sentence summary at the end with ALL relevant file:line references for easy copy-paste into tracking tools

## Important Notes

- ✅ Works across multiple languages and frameworks
- ✅ Automatically detects project structure
- ✅ Generates ready-to-use Burp Suite requests
- ✅ **Trusts user-provided CVE and version information** (no verification required)
- ✅ **Works even without dependency files or installed packages**
- 🚨 **CRITICAL**: Every report MUST end with "Tracking Tool Summary" containing a copy-paste ready summary with all file:line references
- ⚠️ Vulnerability presence ≠ exploitability (thorough analysis required)
- ⚠️ Focus is on **code usage analysis**, not dependency verification
- ⚠️ User has already vetted CVE info through SCA tools (Snyk, Dependabot, etc.)
- ⚠️ Consider deployment environment and network exposure
