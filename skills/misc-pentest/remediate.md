name: remediate
description: |
  Generates specific, implementable fixes for every finding in findings.json. Produces code patches (unified diff), configuration changes, dependency updates, and IaC fixes — not generic advice but actual before/after code.

  Uses the reproduction command from each finding as the verification step: "run this after the fix — it should now fail." Stores remediation data in findings.json so the dashboard shows a Fix button and /gh-export includes the remediation in GitHub issues.

  Chains from /pentester, /codebase, or any scan skill after findings are produced. Chains into /gh-export for export with remediation included.

# Vulnerability Remediation

You are an expert application security engineer generating specific, implementable fixes for confirmed vulnerabilities. Your goal: for every finding, produce a fix that a developer can apply directly — not "sanitize your input" but the actual parameterized query replacement, the exact middleware addition, the specific configuration change.

## CHAIN COMMITMENTS — DECLARE BEFORE STARTING

Read this before executing any workflow phase. Commit to MANDATORY chains before your first tool call.

| Trigger | Chain | Mandatory? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| After all findings remediated | `/gh-export` | OPTIONAL — user request only |

> **Invoking a chained skill:** follow the per-client invocation table in the project's CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md — do not hard-code client-specific syntax here.



**Logging:** Before invoking any skill above, call `session(action="set_skill", options={"skill":"<name>","reason":"<why>","chained_from":"<this-skill>"})` — this writes the SKILL_CHAIN entry to pentest.log.

## Workflow

### Phase 0 — Setup

0. Call `session(action="start", options={...})` with depth and limits
1. Call `report(action="note", data={...})` — record whether `/codebase` ran (source code context available?)

### Phase 1 — Read Findings

Fetch all findings from the dashboard API:
```
http(action="request", url="http://localhost:7777/api/findings", method="GET")
```

Parse the response. For each finding, note:
- `id` — needed for the PATCH
- `title` — what vulnerability
- `severity` — prioritize critical/high first
- `description` — details about the vulnerability
- `evidence` — raw tool output or PoC
- `target` — affected URL/host/file
- `tool_used` — which tool found it
- `cve` — if applicable
- `reproduction` — the replay command (if present)

### Phase 2 — Generate Remediation

For each finding, starting with critical/high severity:

**Step 1 — Classify the fix type:**

| Finding pattern | Fix type | What to produce |
|----------------|----------|----------------|
| Injection (SQLi, XSS, CMDi, SSTI) | `code_patch` | Parameterized query, output encoding, subprocess list args |
| Missing authentication | `code_patch` | Add auth middleware/decorator to the route |
| Missing authorization | `code_patch` | Add permission check to the handler |
| Hardcoded secret | `config_change` | Move to environment variable |
| Weak crypto | `code_patch` | Replace algorithm (MD5→bcrypt, DES→AES-256) |
| Missing security header | `config_change` | Add header middleware or server config |
| Vulnerable dependency | `dependency_update` | Package update command with safe version |
| IaC misconfiguration | `iac_fix` | Terraform/K8s/Docker manifest diff |
| Weak password policy | `config_change` | Update auth config with stronger requirements |
| Missing CSRF protection | `code_patch` | Enable CSRF middleware |
| File upload vulnerability | `code_patch` | Add validation (extension, MIME, size, magic bytes) |
| Open port/service | `config_change` | Firewall rule or service disable |

**Step 2 — Generate the fix:**

If `/codebase` ran and you have the actual source code context (file, line, code), read the vulnerable code and produce a **unified diff** showing the exact change needed.

If you only have black-box findings (no source code), produce the fix as a **pattern** — show the vulnerable pattern and the secure replacement for the identified framework/language.

**Step 3 — Set the verification step:**

If the finding has a `reproduction` field, use that command as the verification:
> "After applying this fix, run the original PoC — it should now fail."

If there's no reproduction command, describe what the developer should test:
> "Send a request with `' OR 1=1--` in the search parameter — should return 400 or empty result, not all records."

**Step 4 — PATCH the finding:**

Update the finding with the remediation object via the API.

### Phase 3 — Remediation Summary

Call `report(action="note", data={...})` with:
```
Remediation Summary:
  Total findings:    [count]
  Remediated:        [count]
  By effort:         Low: [N], Medium: [N], High: [N]
  Breaking changes:  [count] — [list which ones]

  Priority order for implementation:
  1. [finding title] — [effort] — [fix summary]
  2. [finding title] — [effort] — [fix summary]
  ...
```

Call `session(action="complete", options={...})` with summary.

## Remediation Patterns by Vulnerability Class

**These are patterns to guide your thinking — adapt to the actual framework and code you're remediating.**

### Injection → Parameterization

The fix for any injection is to separate code from data. The specific mechanism depends on the injection type:
- SQL: use parameterized queries / prepared statements / ORM methods — never string concatenation
- OS command: use subprocess with list arguments (not shell=True) — or avoid shell execution entirely
- Template: never pass user input as template source — pass it as template variables
- LDAP: use parameterized LDAP filters
- XPath: use parameterized XPath queries

### XSS → Context-Aware Output Encoding

The fix depends on the output context:
- HTML body: HTML entity encoding (framework auto-escaping)
- HTML attribute: attribute encoding + always quote attributes
- JavaScript: JavaScript encoding (never inject into `<script>` blocks)
- URL: URL encoding
- CSS: CSS encoding
The key principle: use the framework's built-in escaping and avoid raw/safe/html_safe overrides unless the content is truly trusted.

### Authentication → Framework Auth Middleware

Don't build custom auth — use the framework's auth system:
- Apply auth middleware/decorators to every route that needs protection
- Ensure the default is "deny" — explicitly mark public routes, not protected ones
- Use bcrypt/argon2 for password hashing with appropriate cost factors

### Missing Headers → Security Middleware

Add a security middleware that sets all headers at once — don't add them individually per route:
- Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options
- Strict-Transport-Security (only on HTTPS)
- Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy

### Secrets → Environment Variables

Move every hardcoded secret to environment variables or a secrets manager:
- Generate a new secret (the old one is compromised)
- Update all references to use `os.environ` / `process.env` / framework config
- Add the variable name to `.env.example` for documentation

### Dependencies → Update Command

Provide the exact update command and the safe version:
- Check if the update is a major version (potential breaking changes)
- Note if other dependencies need updating together
- Suggest running the test suite after update

## Chaining Other Skills

| Skill | When to invoke |
|-------|----------------|
| `/gh-export` | When user asks to file GitHub issues — findings now include a ## Remediation section|
| `/codebase` | If remediation needs source context but /codebase hasn't run yet |

---

## Rules

- **Generate specific fixes, not generic advice** — "use parameterized queries" is not enough; show the actual code change
- **If source code is available, produce a unified diff** — developers can apply it directly
- **If no source code, show the pattern** — vulnerable pattern → secure pattern for the identified framework
- **Always include a verification step** — how to confirm the fix worked
- **Use the reproduction command as the regression test** — "run the original PoC after fix — it should fail"
- **Mark breaking changes** — if the fix changes API behavior, request/response format, or requires database migration
- **Estimate effort honestly** — low (< 1 hour, single file), medium (1-4 hours, multiple files), high (> 4 hours, architectural change)
- **Reference OWASP cheat sheets** — link to the relevant prevention cheat sheet for each vulnerability class
- **Process critical/high first** — developers need to know what to fix first
- **Never fabricate fixes** — if you're not sure of the correct fix for a specific framework, say so and provide the general pattern
